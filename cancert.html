<h2 id="5">Classification</h2>
<hr align="center" color="black" height="2px" width="100%">
<p>
<img src="./Resources/class.jpg" height="400px" width="490px" alt="Classification Of Cancer" align="right">
Cancers are classified by the type of cell that the tumor cells resemble and is therefore presumed to be the origin of the tumor. <br>
These types include:
<ul>
	<li><b>Carcionoma:-</b> Cancers derived from epithelial cells. This group includes many of the most common cancers and include nearly all those in the breast, prostate, lung, pancreas and colon.</li>
	<li><b>Sarcoma:</b> Cancers arising from connective tissue (i.e. bone, cartilage, fat, nerve), each of which develops from cells originating in mesenchymal cells outside the bone marrow</li>
	<li><b>Lymphoma and Leukemia:</b> These two classes arise from hematopoietic (blood-forming) cells that leave the marrow and tend to mature in the lymph nodes and blood, respectively</li>
	<li><b>Germ cell tumor:</b> Cancers derived from pluripotent cells, most often presenting in the testicle or the ovary (seminoma and dysgerminoma, respectively).</li>
	<li><b>Blastoma:</b> Cancers derived from immature "precursor" cells or embryonic tissue</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Cancers are usually named using -carcinoma, -sarcoma or -blastoma as a suffix, 
with the Latin or Greek word for the organ or tissue of origin as the root. 
For example, cancers of the liver parenchyma arising from malignant epithelial cells is called <b>hepatocarcinoma</b>, 
while a malignancy arising from primitive liver precursor cells is called a <b>hepatoblastoma</b> and a cancer arising 
from fat cells is called a liposarcoma. For some common cancers, the English organ name is used. For example, the most 
common type of breast cancer is called ductal carcinoma of the breast. Here, the adjective ductal refers to the appearance 
of cancer under the microscope, which suggests that it has originated in the milk ducts. <br><br>
<b>Benign tumors (which are not cancers)</b> are named using -oma as a suffix with the organ name as the root. For example, 
a benign tumor of smooth muscle cells is called a <b>leiomyoma (the common name of this frequently occurring benign 
tumor in the uterus is fibroid)</b>. Confusingly, some types of cancer use the -noma suffix, examples including melanoma 
and seminoma. 
Some types of cancer are named for the size and shape of the cells under a microscope, such as <b>giant cell carcinoma, 
spindle cell carcinoma</b> and <b>small-cell carcinoma.</b>
</p>
<br>

<!--Prevention-->

<h2 id="6">Prevention</h2>
<hr align="center" color="black" height="2px" width="100%">
<p>
Cancer prevention is defined as active measures to decrease cancer risk. The vast majority of cancer cases are due to 
environmental risk factors. Many of these environmental factors are controllable lifestyle choices. 
Thus, cancer is generally preventable. Between 70% and 90% of common cancers are due to environmental factors 
and therefore potentially preventable. 
Greater than 30% of cancer deaths could be prevented by avoiding risk factors including: tobacco, excess weight/obesity, 
poor diet, physical inactivity, alcohol, sexually transmitted infections and air pollution. Not all environmental causes 
are controllable, such as naturally occurring background radiation and cancers caused through hereditary genetic 
disorders and thus are not preventable via personal behavior.
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="6.1"><span>1. <u>Dietary:-</u></span></h2>
<img src="./Resources/dtr.png" height="450px" width="580px" alt="Prevention Of Cancer - Diet" align="right">
<p>
While many dietary recommendations have been proposed to reduce cancer risks, 
the evidence to support them is not definitive. The primary dietary factors that 
increase risk are obesity and alcohol consumption. Diets low in fruits and vegetables 
and high in red meat have been implicated but reviews and meta-analyses do not 
come to a consistent conclusion A 2014 meta-analysis found no relationship between
 fruits and vegetables and cancer. <b>Coffee is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer.</b>
Studies have linked excess <u>consumption of red or processed meat to an increased risk 
of breast cancer, colon cancer and pancreatic cancer</u>, a phenomenon that could be 
due to the presence of carcinogens in meats cooked at high temperatures. In 2015 
the <b>IARC</b> reported that <u>eating processed meat <b>(e.g., bacon, ham, hot dogs, sausages) </b>
and, to a lesser degree, red meat was linked to some cancers</u>
Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include an emphasis on 
</b>vegetables, fruit, whole grains</b> and <b>fish</b> and an avoidance of processed and <b>red meat 
(beef, pork, lamb), animal fats, pickled foods</b> and <b>refined carbohydrates</b>.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<img src="./Resources/dl.jpg" height="380px" width="430x" alt="Prevention Of Cancer - Medication" style="float: left">
<h3 id="6.2" class="a"><span>2. <u>Medication:-</u></span></h2>
<p class="b">
Medications can be used to prevent cancer in a few circumstances In the general 
population, <b>NSAIDs</b> reduce the risk of colorectal cancer; however, due to 
cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects, they cause overall harm 
when used for prevention. Aspirin has been found to reduce the risk of death 
from cancer by about 7%.COX-2 inhibitors may decrease the rate of polyp formation 
in people with familial <b>Adenomatous Polyposis</b>; however, it is associated with the 
same adverse effects as NSAIDs. Daily use of tamoxifen or raloxifene reduce the 
risk of breast cancer in high-risk women The benefit versus harm for 5-alpha-reductase 
inhibitor such as finasteride is not clear.<br></p>
<p>
Vitamin supplementation does not appear to be effective at preventing cancer While 
low blood levels of vitamin D are correlated with increased cancer risk, whether 
this relationship is causal and vitamin D supplementation is protective is not 
determined. One 2014 review found that supplements had no significant effect 
on cancer risk Another 2014 review concluded that vitamin D3 may decrease the 
risk of death from cancer (one fewer death in 150 people treated over 5 years), 
but concerns with the quality of the data were noted.
<b>Beta-Carotene</b> supplementation increases lung cancer rates in those who are high 
risk Folic acid supplementation is not effective in preventing colon cancer and may 
increase colon polyps.Selenium supplementation has not been shown to reduce the 
risk of cancer.

<h3 id="6.3"><span>3. <u>Vaccination</u></span></h2>
<p>
Vaccines have been developed that prevent infection by some carcinogenic viruses. 
<b>Human Papillomavirus Vaccine (Gardasil and Cervarix)</b> decrease the risk of developing 
cervical cancer. The hepatitis B vaccine prevents infection with hepatitis B virus and 
thus decreases the risk of liver cancer. The administration of human papillomavirus and 
hepatitis B vaccinations is recommended where resources allow.

<!--Management-->

<h2 id="7">Management</h2>
<hr align="center" color="black" height="2px" width="100%">
<p>
Many treatment options for cancer exist. The primary ones include surgery, chemotherapy, 
radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy and palliative care. 
Which treatments are used depends on the type, location and grade of the cancer as well 
as the patient's health and preferences. The treatment intent may or may not be curative
</p>
<br><br>
<br>

<img src="./Resources/adv.jpg" height="300px" width="430px" alt="Management Of Cancer - Chemotherapy" style="float: left">
<h3 id="7.1" class="a"><span>1. <u>Chemotherapy</u></span></h3>
<p class="b">
<b>Chemotherapy</b> is the treatment of cancer with one or more <b>Cytotoxic Anti-Neoplastic Drugs 
(chemotherapeutic agents)</b> as part of a standardized regimen. The term encompasses a variety 
of drugs, which are divided into broad categories such as <b>alkylating agents</b> and <b>antimetabolites</b>. 
Traditional chemotherapeutic agents act by killing cells that divide rapidly, a critical property of 
most cancer cells.<br><br></p>
<br>
<p>
Targeted therapy is a form of chemotherapy that targets specific molecular differences between 
cancer and normal cells. The first targeted therapies blocked the estrogen receptor molecule, 
inhibiting the growth of breast cancer. Another common example is the class of Bcr-Abl inhibitors, 
which are used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Currently, targeted therapies exist 
for many of the most common cancer types, including <b>bladder cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, 
kidney cancer, leukemia, liver cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, 
skin cancer</b>, and <b>thyroid cancer</b> as well as other cancer types.<br><br> 
The efficacy of chemotherapy depends on the type of cancer and the stage. In combination with 
surgery, chemotherapy has proven useful in cancer types including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, 
pancreatic cancer, osteogenic sarcoma, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer and certain lung cancers. 
Chemotherapy is curative for some cancers, such as some leukemias, ineffective in some brain tumors, 
and needless in others, such as most non-melanoma skin cancers. The effectiveness of chemotherapy 
is often limited by its toxicity to other tissues in the body. Even when chemotherapy does not provide 
a permanent cure, it may be useful to reduce symptoms such as pain or to reduce the size of an 
inoperable tumor in the hope that surgery will become possible in the future.
</p>
<br><br>
<br>


<h3 id="7.2"><span>2. <u>Laser Therapy-</u></span></h2>
<img src="./Resources/l.jpg" height="400px" width="500px" alt="Management Of Cancer - Laser therapy" style="float: right">
<p>
Laser therapy uses high-intensity light to treat cancer by <b>shrinking or destroying tumors or precancerous growths. </b>
Lasers are most commonly used to treat superficial cancers that are on the surface of the body or the lining of 
internal organs. It is used to treat basal cell skin cancer and the very early stages of others like <b>cervical, penile, 
vaginal, vulvar</b>, and non-small cell lung cancer. It is often combined with other treatments, such as surgery, 
chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. <b>Laser-Induced Interstitial Thermotherapy (LITT)</b>, or interstitial laser 
photocoagulation, uses lasers to treat some cancers using hyperthermia, which uses heat to shrink tumors 
by damaging or killing cancer cells. Laser are more precise than surgery and cause less damage, pain, 
bleeding, swelling, and scarring. A disadvantage is surgeons must have specialized training. 
It may be more expensive than other treatments.
</p>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>

<img src="./Resources/am.jpg" height="200px" width="300px" alt="Management Of Cancer - Alternative Medicines" style="float: left">
<h3 id="7.3"><span>3. <u>Alternative Medicines:-</u></span></h2>
<p>
Complementary and alternative cancer treatments are a diverse group of therapies, practices and products that 
are not part of conventional medicine. <b>"Complementary medicine"</b> refers to methods and substances used 
along with conventional medicine, while "alternative medicine" refers to compounds used instead of conventional 
medicine. Most complementary and alternative medicines for cancer have not been studied or tested using 
conventional techniques such as clinical trials. Some alternative treatments have been investigated and shown to 
be ineffective but still continue to be marketed and promoted. Cancer researcher <b>Andrew J. Vickers</b> stated, 
The label 'unproven' is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer 
therapies have been 'disproven'.
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="7.4"><span>4. <u>Surgery</u></span></h2>
<p>
Surgery is the primary method of treatment for most isolated, solid cancers and may play a role in palliation 
and prolongation of survival. It is typically an important part of definitive diagnosis and staging of tumors, as 
biopsies are usually required. In localized cancer, surgery typically attempts to remove the entire mass along 
with, in certain cases, the lymph nodes in the area. For some types of cancer this is sufficient to eliminate the 
cancer.
