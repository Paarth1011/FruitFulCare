<!--DIAGNOSIS-->

<h2 id="5">Diagonosis:-</h2>
<hr align="center" color="black" height="2px" width="100%">
<p class="a">
While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one 
universal agreed upon definition. It is defined by the Global 
Initiative for Asthma as "<u>a chronic inflammatory disorder of 
the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a 
role</u>". The chronic inflammation is associated with airway 
hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of 
<b>wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness</b> and <b>coughing</b> 
particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes 
are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow 
obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either 
spontaneously or with treatment"
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="5.1"><span>1. <u>Spirometry:-</u></span></h3>
<img src="./Resources/spm.jpg" height="300px" width="550px" alt="Spirometry" align="right">
<p style="color: deeppink; font-size: 16px">
Spirometry is recommended to aid in diagnosis and management. 
It is the single best test for asthma. <u>If the FEV1 measured by this 
technique improves more than 12%</u> and increases by at least 200 
milliliters following administration of a bronchodilator such as 
<b>Salbutamol</b>, this is supportive of the diagnosis. It however may be 
normal in those with a history of mild asthma, not currently acting 
up. As caffeine is a bronchodilator in people with asthma, the use of 
caffeine before a lung function test may interfere with the results. 
Single-breath diffusing capacity can help differentiate asthma from <b>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</b>. 
It is reasonable to perform spirometry every one or two years to follow 
how well a person's asthma is controlled.

<p style="font-size: 16px; color: deeppink">
An acute asthma exacerbation is commonly referred to as an <b>asthma attack</b>. 
The classic symptoms are <b>shortness of breath, wheezing</b>, and <b>chest tightness</b>. 
The wheezing is most often when breathing out. While these are the primary symptoms 
of asthma, some people present primarily with coughing, and in severe cases, 
air motion may be significantly impaired such that no wheezing is heard. 
In <b>children</b>, <u>chest pain</u> is often present. <br>
Signs occurring during an asthma attack include the use of accessory muscles of 
respiration <b>(sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles of the neck)</b>, there may be 
a paradoxical pulse <b>(a pulse that is weaker during inhalation and stronger during exhalation)</b>, 
and over-inflation of the chest. A blue color of the skin and nails may occur from lack of oxygen. <br>
In a mild exacerbation the <b>Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) is =200 L/min</b>, or =50% of the 
predicted best. Moderate is defined as <b>between 80 and 200 L/min</b>, or 25% and 50% of the 
predicted best, while severe is defined as = 80 L/min, or =25% of the predicted best.</p>

<p>Acute severe asthma, previously known as status asthmaticus, is an acute exacerbation of asthma 
that does not respond to standard treatments of <b>bronchodilators</b> and <b>corticosteroids</b>. 
Half of cases are due to infections with others caused by allergen, air pollution, or insufficient or 
inappropriate medication use.
Brittle asthma is a kind of asthma distinguishable by recurrent, severe attacks. 
<u>Type 1</u> brittle asthma is a disease with <b>wide peak flow variability</b>, despite intense medication. 
Type 2 brittle asthma is background well-controlled asthma with <b>sudden severe exacerbations</b>.
</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3 id="5.3" class="a"><span>3. <u>Differential Diagnosis:-</u></span></h3>
<img src="./Resources/dd.png" height="320px" width="400px" alt="Differential Diagnosis" align="left">
<p class="b">
Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. 
In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as 
<b>allergic rhinitis</b> and <b>sinusitis</b>, as well as other causes of 
airway obstruction including foreign <b>body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, 
laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes</b> or <b>neck masses</b>. 
Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing. 
In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced 
coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. 
In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly. <br><br></p>

<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can coexist with asthma and can occur 
as a complication of chronic asthma. After the age of 65, most people with 
obstructive airway disease will have asthma and COPD. In this setting, 
COPD can be differentiated by increased airway neutrophils, 
abnormally increased wall thickness, and increased smooth muscle in the bronchi. 
However, this level of investigation is not performed due to COPD and asthma 
sharing similar principles of management: <b>corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists</b> and 
<b>smoking cessation</b>. It closely resembles asthma in symptoms, is correlated with more 
exposure to cigarette smoke, an older age, less symptom reversibility after 
bronchodilator administration, and decreased likelihood of family history of atopy.
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="5.4"><span>4. <u>Others:-</u></span></h3>
<p>
The <b>methacholine</b> challenge involves the inhalation of increasing concentrations of a 
substance that causes airway narrowing in those predisposed. If negative it means that a person 
does not have asthma; if positive, however, it is not specific for the disease.
Other supportive evidence includes: a =20% difference in peak expiratory flow rate on at 
least three days in a week for at least two weeks, a =20% improvement of peak flow 
following treatment with either <b>salbutamol</b>, <b>inhaled corticosteroids</b> or <b>prednisone</b>, 
or a =20% decrease in peak flow following exposure to a trigger. Testing peak expiratory flow is 
more variable than spirometry, however, and thus not recommended for routine diagnosis. 
It may be useful for daily self-monitoring in those with moderate to severe disease and for 
checking the effectiveness of new medications. It may also be helpful in guiding treatment in 
those with acute exacerbations.
</p>
<br>

<!--PREVENTION-->

<h2 id="6">Prevention:-</h2>
<hr align="center" color="black" height="2px" width="100%">
<img src="./Resources/apj.png" height="420px" width="500px" alt="Asthma Prevention" align="right">
<p>
The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak. 
The <b>World Health Organization (WHO)</b> recommends decreasing risk factors such as 
<b>tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants</b> including perfume, and the number 
of lower respiratory infections. Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke 
exposure in <b>utero, breastfeeding</b>, and <b>increased exposure to daycare</b> or 
large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication. <br> <br> 
<b>Early pet exposure</b> may be useful. Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive 
and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic 
symptoms to said pet. <br> <br>
<b>Dietary restrictions during pregnancy</b> or <b>when breast feeding</b> have not 
been found to be effective at preventing asthma in children and are not recommended. 
Reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the work place may be effective. 
It is not clear if annual influenza vaccinations affects the risk of exacerbations. 
Immunization, however, is recommended by the World Health Organization. 
<b>Smoking bans</b> are effective in decreasing exacerbations of asthma.
</p>
<br>

<!--MANAGEMENT-->

<h2 id="7">Management:-</h2>
<hr align="center" color="black" height="2px" width="100%">
<p>
While there is no cure for asthma, symptoms can typically be improved. The most effective treatment 
for asthma is identifying triggers, such as cigarette smoke, pets, or aspirin, and eliminating exposure to them. 
If trigger avoidance is insufficient, the use of medication is recommended. Pharmaceutical drugs are 
selected based on, among other things, the severity of illness and the frequency of symptoms. 
Specific medications for asthma are broadly classified into fast-acting and long-acting categories. <br><br>
Bronchodilators are recommended for short-term relief of symptoms. In those with occasional attacks, 
no other medication is needed. If mild persistent disease is present (more than two attacks a week), 
low-dose inhaled corticosteroids or alternatively, a leukotriene antagonist or a mast cell 
stabilizer by mouth is recommended. For those who have daily attacks, a higher dose of inhaled 
corticosteroids is used. In a moderate or severe exacerbation, corticosteroids by mouth are added 
to these treatments.
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="7.1"><span>1. <u>Lifestyle Modifications:-</u></span></h3>
<img src="./Resources/lmn.png" height="380px" width="460px" alt="Lifestyle Modifications" align="right">
<p>
<u>Avoidance of triggers is a key component of improving control and preventing attacks</u>. 
The most common triggers include <b>allergens, smoke (from tobacco or other sources), air pollution</b>, 
non selective beta-blockers, and sulfite-containing foods. Cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke 
(passive smoke) may reduce the effectiveness of medications such as <b>corticosteroids</b>. 
Laws that limit smoking decrease the number of people hospitalized for asthma. 
<b>Dust mite</b> control measures, including <u>air filtration</u>, <u>chemicals to kill mites</u>, <u>vacuuming</u>, 
mattress covers and others methods had no effect on asthma symptoms. 
There is insufficient evidence to suggest that dehumidifiers are helpful for controlling asthma. <br><br>
Overall, exercise is beneficial in people with stable asthma. <b>Yoga</b> could provide small improvements 
in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma. More research is necessary to determine 
how effective <b>weight loss is on improving quality of life</b>, the usage of health care services, 
and adverse effects for people of all ages with asthma
</p>
<br>
<br>


<h3 id="7.2" class="a"><span>2. <u>Alternative Medications:-</u></span></h3>
<img src="./Resources/inhaler.jpg" height="320px" width="400px" alt="Alternative Medications - Inhaler" align="left">
<p class="b">
Evidence is insufficient to support the <b>usage of vitamin C or vitamin E</b> for <u>controlling asthma</u>. 
There is tentative support for use of vitamin C in exercise induced <b>bronchospasm</b>. 
Fish oil dietary supplements (marine n-3 fatty acids) and reducing dietary sodium do not appear 
to help improve asthma control. In people with mild to moderate asthma, <b>treatment with vitamin D 
supplementation</b> may reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations, however, it is not clear 
if this is only helpful for people who have low vitamin D levels to begin with (low baseline vitamin D). 
There is no strong evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplements improve day-to-day asthma 
symptoms or a person's lung function. There is no strong evidence to suggest that adults with 
asthma should avoid foods that contain <b>MonoSodium Glutamate (MSG)</b>. There have not been 
enough high-quality studies performed to determine if children with asthma should avoid eating 
food that contains MSG. <br><br></p>

<p>
<b>Acupuncture is not recommended</b> for the treatment as there is insufficient evidence to support its use. 
Air ionisers show no evidence that they improve asthma symptoms or benefit lung function; this applied equally 
to positive and negative ion generators. Manual therapies, including <b>osteopathic, chiropractic, physiotherapeutic</b> 
and <b>respiratory therapeutic maneuvers</b>, have insufficient evidence to support their use in treating asthma. 
The Buteyko breathing technique for controlling hyperventilation may result in a reduction in medication use; 
however, the technique does not have any effect on lung function. 
Thus an expert panel felt that evidence was insufficient to support its use. 
There is no clear evidence that breathing exercises are effective for treating children with asthma

<h3 id="7.3"><span>3. <u>Others:-</u></span></h3>
<p>
Inflammation in the lungs can be estimated by the level of exhaled <b>Nitric Oxide (FeNO)</b>. 
The use of exhaled nitric oxide levels (FeNO) to guide asthma medication dosing may have small 
benefits for preventing asthma attacks but the potential benefits are not strong enough for this 
approach to be universally recommended as a method to guide asthma therapy in adults or children. <br><br>
When asthma is unresponsive to usual medications, other options are available for both emergency 
management and prevention of flareups. <br><br>
<u>Additional options include:-</u>

<!--MANAGEMENT LIST-->

<ul>
	<li>Oxygen to alleviate hypoxia if saturations fall below 92%.</li>
	<li>Corticosteroid by mouth are recommended with five days of prednisone being the same 2 days of dexamethasone. One review recommended a seven-day course of steroids</li>
	<li> Heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen, may also be considered in severe unresponsive cases.</li>
	<li>Intravenous salbutamol is not supported by available evidence and is thus used only in extreme cases</li>
	<li>Methylxanthines (such as theophylline) were once widely used, but do not add significantly to the effects of inhaled beta-agonists. Their use in acute exacerbations is controversial.</li>
	<li>For those with severe persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs, bronchial thermoplasty may be an option. It involves the delivery of controlled thermal energy to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopies. While it may increase exacerbation frequency in the first few months it appears to decrease the subsequent rate. Effects beyond one year are unknown.</li>
	<li>The dissociative anesthetic ketamine is theoretically useful if intubation and mechanical ventilation is needed in people who are approaching respiratory arrest; however, there is no evidence from clinical trials to support this</li>
	<li>Evidence suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma improve outcomes.</li>	
	<li>It is unclear if non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in children is of use as it has not been sufficiently studied.</li>	
</ul>
