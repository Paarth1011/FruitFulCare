<!--INTRODUCTION-->

<p class="a">
<b>Diabetes Mellitus (DM)</b>, commonly known as <b>Diabetes</b>, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by a high blood 
sugar level over a prolonged period of time.Symptoms often include<b>frequent urination, increased thirst</b> and <b>increased appetite</b>. 
If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications.<b> Acute complications</b> can include <b>diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar 
hyperglycemic state</b> or <b>death.</b>Serious long-term complications include <b>cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, 
foot ulcers, damage to the nerves, damage to the eyes</b> and <b>cognitive impairment.</b> Diabetes is due to either the pancreas not 
producing enough insulin, or the cells of the body not responding properly to the insulin produced.  As of 2019, an estimated 463 million 
people had diabetes worldwide (8.8% of the adult population), with <b>type 2 diabetes making up about 90% of the cases</b>. Rates 
are similar in women and men. Trends suggest that rates will continue to rise. Diabetes at least doubles a person's risk of early death.
<b> In 2019, diabetes resulted in approximately 4.2 million deaths</b>. It is the 7th leading cause of death globally. The global 
economic cost of diabetes related health expenditure in 2017 was estimated at <b>US$727 billion</b> . In the United States, 
diabetes cost nearly <b>US$327 billion</b> in 2017. Average medical expenditures among people with diabetes are about 2.3 times higher.

<!--SYMPTOMS-->

<h2 id="1">Symptoms</h2>
<hr align="center" color="black" height="2px" width="100%">
<p>
The classic symptoms of untreated diabetes are <b>unintended weight loss, polyuria (increased urination), polydipsia (increased thirst),</b> 
and <b>polyphagia (increased hunger)</b>. Symptoms may develop rapidly (weeks or months) in type 1 diabetes, while they usually develop 
much more slowly and may be subtle or absent in type 2 diabetes.<br><br>
The other symptoms are as follows:-
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="1.1"><span>1. <u>Diabetic Emergencies</u></span></h3>
<img src="./Resources/sd.png" height="450px" width="460px" alt="Symptoms Of Diabetes" style="float: right">
<p>
People with diabetes (usually but not exclusively in type 1 diabetes) may also experience <b>Diabetic KetoAcidosis (DKA)</b>, 
a metabolic disturbance characterized by <b>nausea, vomiting</b> and <b>abdominal pain</b>, the smell of acetone on the 
breath, deep breathing known as Kussmaul breathing, and in severe cases a decreased level of consciousness. DKA requires 
emergency treatment in hospital. A rarer but more dangerous condition is <b>Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS)</b>, 
which is more common in type 2 diabetes and is mainly the result of dehydration caused by high blood sugars<br><br>
Treatment-related low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) is common in people with type 1 and also type 2 diabetes depending on 
the medication being used. Most cases are mild and are not considered medical emergencies. Effects can range from feelings 
of unease, sweating, trembling, and increased appetite in mild cases to more serious effects such as confusion, changes in 
behavior such as <b>aggressiveness, seizures, unconsciousness</b>, and <b>rarely permanent brain damage or death</b> in severe cases. 
<b>Rapid breathing, sweating</b>, and <b>cold, pale skin</b> are characteristic of low blood sugar but not definitive. Mild to moderate cases 
are self-treated by eating or drinking something high in rapidly absorbed carbohydrates. Severe cases can lead to 
unconsciousness and must be treated with intravenous glucose or injections with glucagon.

<h3 id="1.2" class="a"><span>2. <u>Complications</u></span></h3>
<p class="b">
The primary complications of diabetes due to damage in small blood vessels include <b>damage to the eyes, kidneys</b>, and <b>nerves</b>. 
Damage to the eyes, known as <b>Diabetic Retinopathy</b>, is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina of the eye, and can 
result in gradual vision loss and eventual blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of having <b>glaucoma, cataracts</b>, and other 
eye problems. It is recommended that people with diabetes visit an eye doctor once a year. Damage to the kidneys, known 
as diabetic nephropathy, can lead to tissue scarring, urine protein loss, and eventually chronic kidney disease, sometimes 
requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation. 
Damage to the nerves of the body, known as <b>Diabetic Neuropathy</b>, is the 
most common complication of diabetes. The symptoms can include numbness, tingling, pain, and altered pain sensation, 
which can lead to damage to the skin. Diabetes-related foot problems (such as diabetic foot ulcers) may occur, and can be 
difficult to treat, occasionally requiring amputation. Additionally, proximal diabetic neuropathy causes painful muscle atrophy 
and weakness. <br><br>

<p>
Diabetes mellitus is classified into six categories: <b>Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, Hybrid forms of diabetes, Hyperglycemia</b> 
first detected during pregnancy, <b>"Unclassified diabetes"</b>, and <b>"Other specific types"</b>. The "hybrid forms of diabetes" contains 
slowly evolving, immune-mediated diabetes of adults and ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes. The "hyperglycemia first detected 
during pregnancy" contains gestational diabetes mellitus and diabetes mellitus in pregnancy (type 1 or type 2 diabetes first 
diagnosed during pregnancy). The "other specific types" are a collection of a few dozen individual causes. Diabetes is a more 
variable disease than once thought and people may have combinations of forms.The term "diabetes", without qualification, 
refers to diabetes mellitus.
</p>
<br><br>
<br>

<img src="./Resources/cdw.png" height="410px" width="530px" alt="Causes Of Diabetes" style="float: left">
<h3 id="3.1" class="a"><span>1. <u>Type 1</u></span></h3>
<p class="b">
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by loss of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreatic islets, leading to insulin 
deficiency. This type can be further classified as immune-mediated or idiopathic. The majority of type 1 diabetes is of an 
immune-mediated nature, in which a T cell-mediated autoimmune attack leads to the loss of beta cells and thus insulin. 
It causes approximately <b>10% of diabetes mellitus</b> cases in <b>North America</b> and <b>Europe</b>. Most affected people are otherwise 
healthy and of a healthy weight when onset occurs. Sensitivity and responsiveness to insulin are usually normal, especially 
in the early stages. Although it has been called <b>"juvenile diabetes"</b> due to the frequent onset in children, the majority of 
individuals living with type 1 diabetes are now adults. <br><br>
</p>

<p>
<b>"Brittle" diabetes</b>, also known as unstable diabetes or <b>labile diabetes</b>, 
is a term that was traditionally used to describe the dramatic and recurrent swings in glucose levels, often occurring for no 
apparent reason in insulin-dependent diabetes. This term, however, has no biologic basis and should not be used.Still, type 1 
diabetes can be accompanied by irregular and unpredictable high blood sugar levels, and the potential for <b>diabetic 
ketoacidosis</b> or serious low blood sugar levels. Other complications include an impaired counterregulatory response to 
low blood sugar, infection, gastroparesis (which leads to erratic absorption of dietary carbohydrates), and 
<b>endocrinopathies (e.g., Addison's disease)</b>. These phenomena are believed to occur no more frequently than in 1% to 2% of persons 
with type 1 diabetes.
</p>
<br><br>

<h3 id="3.2"><span>2. <u>Type 2</u></span></h3>
<img src="./Resources/cd.jpg" height="380px" width="500px" alt="Causes Of Diabetes" style="float: right">
<p>
Reduced insulin secretion and absorption leads to high glucose content in the blood. 
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance, which may be combined with relatively reduced insulin secretion. 
The defective responsiveness of body tissues to insulin is believed to involve the insulin receptor. However, the specific 
defects are not known. Diabetes mellitus cases due to a known defect are classified separately. 
Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes mellitus.Many people with type 2 diabetes have evidence of 
prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance) before meeting the criteria for type 2 diabetes. 
The progression of prediabetes to overt type 2 diabetes can be slowed or reversed by lifestyle changes or medications that 
improve insulin sensitivity or reduce the liver's glucose production. <br><br>
Type 2 diabetes is primarily due to lifestyle factors and genetics. A number of lifestyle factors are known to be important 
to the development of type 2 diabetes, <b>including obesity (defined by a body mass index of greater than 30), lack of physical 
activity, poor diet, stress</b>, and <b>urbanization</b>. Excess body fat is associated with 30% of cases in people of Chinese and 
Japanese descent, 60 - 80% of cases in those of European and African descent, and <b>100% of Pima Indians and Pacific 
Islanders.</b> Even those who are not obese may have a high waist - hip ratio.
</p>
<br>


<h3 id="3.3"><span>3. <u>Gestational Diabetes</u></span></h3>
<img src="./Resources/dg.jpg" height="430px" width="550px" alt="Causes Of Diabetes" style="float: right">
<p>
Gestational diabetes resembles type 2 diabetes in several respects, involving a combination of relatively inadequate 
insulin secretion and responsiveness. It occurs in about 2 - 10% of all pregnancies and may improve or disappear after 
delivery. It is recommended that all pregnant women get tested starting around 24 - 28 weeks gestation.It is most often 
diagnosed in the second or third trimester because of the increase in insulin-antagonist hormone levels that occurs at 
this time.However, after pregnancy approximately 5 - 10% of women with gestational diabetes are found to have another 
form of diabetes, most commonly type 2.Gestational diabetes is fully treatable, but requires careful medical supervision 
throughout the pregnancy. Management may include <b>dietary changes, blood glucose monitoring</b>, and in some cases, 
insulin may be required.<br><br>
Though it may be transient, untreated gestational diabetes can damage the health of the fetus or mother. 
Risks to the baby include <b>macrosomia (high birth weight)</b>, congenital heart and central nervous system 
abnormalities, and skeletal muscle malformations. Increased levels of insulin in a fetus's blood may inhibit 
fetal surfactant production and cause infant respiratory distress syndrome. A high blood bilirubin level may 
result from red blood cell destruction. In severe cases, perinatal death may occur, most commonly as a result 
of poor placental perfusion due to vascular impairment. Labor induction may be indicated with decreased placental 
function. A caesarean section may be performed if there is marked fetal distress or an increased risk of injury 
associated with macrosomia, such as shoulder dystocia.
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="3.4"><span>4. <u>Other types</u></span></h3>
<p>
Some cases of diabetes are caused by the body's tissue receptors not responding to insulin 
(even when insulin levels are normal, which is what separates it from type 2 diabetes); this form is very uncommon. 
Genetic mutations (autosomal or mitochondrial) can lead to defects in beta cell function. 
Abnormal insulin action may also have been genetically determined in some cases. 
Any disease that causes extensive damage to the pancreas may lead to diabetes 
(for example, chronic pancreatitis and <b>cystic fibrosis</b>). Diseases associated with excessive secretion of 
insulin-antagonistic hormones can cause diabetes (which is typically resolved once the hormone excess is removed). 
Many drugs impair insulin secretion and some toxins damage pancreatic beta cells, whereas others increase insulin 
resistance (especially <b>glucocorticoids</b> which can provoke <b>"steroid diabetes"</b>). <b>The ICD-10 (1992)</b> diagnostic entity, 
<b>Malnutrition - Related Diabetes Mellitus (MRDM or MMDM, ICD-10 code E12)</b>, was deprecated by the <b>World Health Organization (WHO)</b> 
when the current taxonomy was introduced in 1999. Yet another form of diabetes that people may develop is double diabetes. 
This is when a type 1 diabetic becomes insulin resistant, the hallmark for type 2 diabetes or has a family history for type 2 diabetes. 
It was first discovered in 1990 or 1991.<br><br>

A positive result, in the absence of unequivocal high blood sugar, should be confirmed by a repeat of any of the above methods on a 
different day. It is preferable to measure a fasting glucose level because of the ease of measurement and the considerable time 
commitment of formal glucose tolerance testing, which takes two hours to complete and offers no prognostic advantage over the 
fasting test. According to the current definition, two fasting glucose measurements above <b>7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL)</b> is considered 
diagnostic for diabetes mellitus.<br><br><br>

Glycated hemoglobin is better than fasting glucose for determining risks of cardiovascular disease and death from any cause
