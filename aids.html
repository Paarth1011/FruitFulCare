<b>Human Immuno-deficiency Virus</b> infection and <b>Acquired 
Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS)</b> is a spectrum 
of conditions caused by infection with the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a <b>retrovirus</b>. 
Following initial infection a person may not notice any 
symptoms, or may experience a <b>brief period of influenza-like 
illness</b>. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with 
no symptoms. If the infection progresses, it interferes more 
with the immune system, increasing the risk of developing 
common infections such as tuberculosis, as well as other 
opportunistic infections, and tumors which are otherwise 
rare in people who have normal immune function. 
These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also 
associated with <b>unintended weight loss</b>.

<!--SYMPTOMS-->

<h2 id="1">Symptoms:-</h2>
<hr align="center" color="black" height="2px" width="100%">
<p>
There are three main stages of the symptoms of HIV infection: <b>Acute Infection</b>, <b>Clinical Latency</b>, and <b>AIDS</b>.
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="1.1"><span>1. <u>Acute Infections:-</span></u></h3>
<p>
<img src="./Resources/hivs.jpg" height="440px" width="420px" alt="HIV / AIDS Symptoms" align="right">
<b>The initial period following the contraction of HIV is called acute HIV, 
primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome</b>. Many individuals develop 
an influenza-like illness or a mononucleosis-like illness 2-4 weeks 
after exposure while others have no significant symptoms. 
Symptoms occur in 40-90% of cases and most commonly 
include<u> fever, large tender lymph nodes, throat inflammation, 
a rash, headache, tiredness, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals.
The rash</u>, which occurs in 20-50% of cases, presents itself on the trunk 
and is maculopapular, classically. Some people also develop some
opportunistic infections at this stage. <u>Gastrointestinal symptoms, 
such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur.</u> <u>Neurological symptoms 
of peripheral neuropathy or Guillain Barr syndrome also occurs.</u> 
The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks.
Owing to their nonspecific character, these symptoms are not often 
recognized as signs of HIV infection. Even cases that do get seen by a 
family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed as one of the many 
common infectious diseases with overlapping symptoms. 
Thus, it is recommended that HIV be considered in people presenting 
with an unexplained fever who may have risk factors for the infection.
</p>
<br>
<br>

<img src="./Resources/cl.jpg" height="450px" width="360px" alt="HIV Symptoms (Clinical Latency)" align="left">
<h3 id="1.2" class="a"><span>2. <u>Clinical Latency:-</u></span></h3>
<p class="b">
<b>The initial symptoms are followed by a stage called clinical latency,
asymptomatic HIV, or chronic HIV</b>.Without treatment, this second 
stage of the natural history of HIV infection can last from about 
three years to over 20 years (on average, about eight years).
 While typically there are few or no symptoms at first, near the 
end of this stage many people <u>experience fever, weight loss, 
gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains</u>. Between 50% and 70% 
of people also develop <u>persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, 
characterized by unexplained, non-painful enlargement of more 
than one group of lymph nodes (other than in the groin)</u> for over 
three to six months.Although most HIV-1 infected individuals have a
detectable viral load and in the absence of treatment will eventually 
progress to AIDS, a small proportion (about 5%) retain high levels of 
CD4+ T cells (T helper cells) without antiretroviral therapy for more 
than five years. These individuals are classified as "HIV controllers" 
or long-term nonprogressors (LTNP). Another group consists of those 
who maintain a low or undetectable viral load without anti-retroviral 
treatment, known as "elite controllers" or "elite suppressors". They 
represent approximately 1 in 300 infected persons.
</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3 id="1.3"><span>3. <u>AIDS:-</u></span></h3>
<img src="./Resources/hivp.jpg" height="390px" width="490px" alt="HIV Virus Progression" align="right">
<p>
<b>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is defined as an HIV 
infection with either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per �L</b> 
or the occurrence of specific diseases associated with HIV infection. 
In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected 
with HIV develop AIDS within ten years. The most common initial 
conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis 
pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), 
and esophageal candidiasis. Other common signs include recurrent respiratory tract infections.
Opportunistic infections may be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, 
and parasites that are normally controlled by the immune system. 
Which infections occur depends partly on what organisms are common 
in the person's environment. These infections may affect nearly every organ system.
Additionally, people with AIDS frequently have <u>systemic symptoms such as 
prolonged fevers, sweats (particularly at night), swollen lymph nodes, chills, 
weakness, and unintended weight loss</u>. <b>Diarrhea</b> is another common symptom, 
present in about 90% of people with AIDS. They can also be affected by diverse 
psychiatric and neurological symptoms independent of opportunistic infections and cancers.

<!--TRANSMISSION-->

<h2 id="3">Transmission:-</h2>
<hr align="center" color="black" height="2px" width="100%">
<p>
The HIV Virus can be transmitted to one another through three modes:-
</p>
<br>
<img src="./Resources/mot.jpg" height="360px" width="430px" alt="Modes Of Transmission Of HIV Virus">
<img src="./Resources/r.jpg" height="350px" width="520px" alt="Helping Hands For HIV" align="right">
<br><br><br>
<h3 id="3.1"><span>1. <u>Sexual Contact:-</u></span></h3>
<p>
The most frequent mode of transmission of HIV is through <b>sexual contact with an infected person. </b> 
However, an HIV-positive person who has an undetectable viral load as a result of long-term 
treatment has effectively no risk of transmitting HIV sexually. The existence of functionally 
noncontagious HIV-positive people on antiretroviral therapy was controversially publicized 
in the <b>2008 Swiss Statement</b>, and has since become accepted as medically sound.
<br><br>
Globally, the most common mode of HIV transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the 
opposite sex; however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries. As of 2017, 
most HIV transmission in the United States occurred <b>among men who had sex with men</b> 
(82% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 70% of total new diagnoses). 
In the US,<b> gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24</b> accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses 
among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<img src="./Resources/bf.png" height="400px" width="450px" alt="Body Fluids Transmitting HIV" align="right">
<h3 id="3.2"><span>2. <u>Body Fluids:-</u></span></h3>
<p>
The <b>second-most frequent mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products.</b> 
Blood-borne transmission can be through <u>needle-sharing</u> during intravenous drug use, 
<u>needle-stick injury</u>, <u>transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product</u>, or <u>medical injections 
with unsterilized equipment</u>. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 
0.63% and 2.4% per act, with an <u>average of 0.8%</u>. The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick 
from an HIV-infected person is estimated as <u>0.3% (about 1 in 333)</u> per act and the risk following 
mucous <u>membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000)</u> per act. This risk may, 
however, be up to 5% if the introduced blood was from a person with a high viral load and the 
cut was deep. In the United States intravenous drug users made up <b>12% of all new cases of HIV in 
2009</b>, and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV-positive
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="3.3"><span>3. <u>Mother - To  - Child:-</u></span></h3>
<img src="./Resources/mtc.png" height="400px" width="450px" alt="Mother - To  - Child Transmission of HIV" align="right">
<p>
HIV can also be transmitted from <u><b>mother to child during pregnancy</b></u>, 
<u><b>during delivery</b></u>, or <u><b>through breast milk</b></u>, 
resulting in the baby also contracting HIV. As of 2008, <b>vertical transmission</b> accounted for <u>about 90%</u> of 
cases of HIV in children. In the absence of treatment, the risk of transmission <b>before or during birth</b> is 
<u>around 20%</u>, and in those who also <b>breastfeed</b> <u>35%</u>. Treatment decreases this risk to less than 5%.
<br>
<br>
<b>Antiretrovirals</b> when taken by either the mother or the baby decrease the risk of transmission in those who do breastfeed. 
If blood contaminates food during pre-chewing it may pose a risk of transmission. If a woman is untreated, two years 
of breastfeeding results in an <b>HIV/AIDS risk in her baby</b> of <u>about 17%</u>. Due to the increased risk of death without 
breastfeeding in many areas in the developing world, the <b>World Health Organization (WHO)</b> recommends either exclusive 
breastfeeding or the provision of safe formula. All women known to be HIV-positive should be taking lifelong antiretroviral therapy.
</p>

<!--DIAGNOSIS-->

<BR>
<BR>
<h2 id="4">Diagnosis-</h2>
<hr align="center" color="black" height="2px" width="100%">
<p>
The act of identifying a disease on the basis of its signs and symptoms is called a Diagnosis of Disease.<br>
The diagnosis of HIV / AIDS can be done using two methods:-
</p>
<br>
<img src="./Resources/q.png" height="300px" width="550px" alt="Diagnosis">
<img src="./Resources/hivt.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" alt="Diagnosis" align="right">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<img src="./Resources/qw.jpg" height="350px" width="450px" alt="Laboratory Testing Of HIV" align="right">
<h3 id="4.1"><span>1. <u>HIV Testing:-</u></span></h3>
<p>
Most people infected with HIV develop <b>specific antibodies (i.e. seroconvert)</b> within three to twelve weeks after the initial 
infection. Diagnosis of <b>primary HIV</b> before seroconversion is done <u>by measuring HIV-RNA or p24 antigen</u>. Positive results 
obtained by antibody or PCR testing are confirmed either by a different antibody or by PCR.
Antibody tests in children younger than 18 months are typically inaccurate, due to the continued presence of maternal 
antibodies. Thus HIV infection can only be diagnosed by <u>PCR testing for HIV RNA or DNA</u>, or via testing for the p24 antigen.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3 id="4.2"><span>2. <u>Clinical Classification:-</u></span></h3>
<p>
<img src="./Resources/i.png" height="400px" width="450px" alt="Clinical Classification Of HIV" align="right">
Two main clinical staging systems are used to <b>classify HIV and HIV-related disease</b> for surveillance purposes: 
the WHO disease <u><b>Staging System for HIV Infection</b></u> and disease, and the <b><u>CDC Classification System</u></b> for HIV 
infection. The CDC's classification system is more frequently adopted in developed countries. Since the 
WHO's staging system does not require laboratory tests, it is suited to the resource-restricted conditions 
encountered in developing countries, where it can also be used to help guide clinical management. 
Despite their differences, the two systems allow comparison for statistical purposes.<br><br>
his system classifies HIV infections <b>based on CD4 count</b> and <b>clinical symptoms</b>, and describes the infection in five groups, In those greater 
than six years of age it is as follows:-
<ul>
<li><u>Stage 0</u>: the time between a negative or indeterminate HIV test 
<li><u>Stage 1</u>: CD4 count = 500 cells/l and no AIDS-defining conditions.</li>
<li><u>Stage 2</u>: CD4 count 200-500 cells/l & no AIDS-defining conditions.</li>
<li><u>Stage 3</u>: CD4 count = 200 cells/l or AIDS-defining conditions.</li>
<li><u>Unknown</u>: if insufficient information is available to make any of the above classifications.</li>
</ul>
