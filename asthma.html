<b>Asthma</b> is a long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. 
It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow 
obstruction, and easily triggered bronchospasms. Symptoms include 
episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. 
These may occur a few times a day or a few times per week. Depending 
on the person, asthma symptoms may become worse at night or with exercise.
Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of <b>genetic</b> and <b>environmental factors</b>. 
Environmental factors include exposure to <b>air pollution</b> and <b>allergens</b>. 
Other potential triggers include medications such as <b>aspirin</b> and <b>beta blockers</b>.<br>
There is <b>no known cure</b> for asthma, but it is <u>easily treatable</u>. Symptoms can be prevented 
by avoiding triggers, such as <b>allergens</b> and <b>respiratory irritants</b>, and suppressed with the use of <b>inhaled corticosteroids</b>.

<p>
Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of <b><u>wheezing</b></u>, <b><u>shortness of breath</b></u>, 
<b><u>chest tightness</b></u>, and <b><u>coughing</b></u>. Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing 
but is often hard to bring up. During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), 
it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called -<b>eosinophils</b>. 
Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise 
or cold air. Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in 
response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience 
persistent symptoms.
</p>

<img src="./Resources/pqr.png" height="240px" width="390px" alt="Asthma Symptoms" align="left">
<p class="b">
A number of other health conditions occur more frequently in people with asthma, 
including <b>Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)</b>, <b>rhinosinusitis</b>, and obstructive sleep apnea. 
Psychological disorders are also more common, with anxiety disorders occurring in between 
16�52% and mood disorders in 14�41%. It is not known whether asthma causes 
psychological problems or psychological problems lead to asthma. Those with asthma, 
especially if it is poorly controlled, are at increased risk for radiocontrast reactions.
Cavities occur more often in people with asthma. This may be related to the effect of 
beta 2 agonists decreasing saliva. These medications may also increase the risk of 
<b>dental erosions</b>.

<!--CAUSES-->

<h2 id="3">Causes:-</h2>
<hr align="center" color="black" height="2px" width="100%">
<p>
Asthma is caused by a combination of complex and incompletely understood environmental 
and genetic interactions. These influence both its severity and its responsiveness to treatment.
Asthama can be caused due to four factors as follows:-
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="3.1"><span>1. <u>Environmental Causes:-</u></span></h3>
<img src="./Resources/ec.png" height="330px" width="380px" alt="Asthma Causes" align="right">
<p>
Many environmental factors have been associated with asthma's development and exacerbation, 
including, <b>allergens</b>, <b>air pollution</b>, and other <b>environmental chemicals</b>. Smoking during 
pregnancy</b> and <b>after delivery</b> is associated with a greater risk of asthma-like symptoms. 
Low air quality from environmental factors such as <b>traffic pollution</b> or <b>high ozone levels</b>
has been associated with both asthma development and increased asthma severity. Over 
half of cases in children in the United States occur in areas when air quality is below the <b>EPA</b> 
standards. Low air quality is more common in low-income and minority communities.
<br><br>
Exposure to indoor volatile organic compounds may be a trigger for asthma; <b>formaldehyde 
exposure</b>, for example, has a positive association. <b>Phthalates</b> in certain types of PVC are 
associated with asthma in both children and adults. While exposure to pesticides is 
linked to the development of asthma, a cause and effect relationship has yet to be established.
<br><br>
Asthma is associated with exposure to indoor allergens. Common indoor allergens include <b>dust mites</b>, 
<b>cockroaches</b>, <b>animal dander (fragments of fur or feathers)</b>, and <b>mold.</b>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
	
<img src="./Resources/tfws.png" height="380px" width="430px" alt="Asthma Causes" align="left">
<h3 id="3.2" class="a"><span>2. <u>Hygiene Hypothesis:-</u></span></h3>
<p class="b">
The hygiene hypothesis attempts to explain the increased rates of asthma worldwide as a direct and 
unintended result of reduced exposure, during childhood, to <b>non-pathogenic bacteria</b> and <b>viruses</b>. 
It has been proposed that the reduced exposure to bacteria and viruses is due, in part, to increased 
cleanliness and decreased family size in modern societies. Exposure to bacterial endotoxin in early 
childhood may prevent the development of asthma, but exposure at an older age may provoke 
bronchoconstriction. Evidence supporting the hygiene hypothesis includes lower rates of 
asthma on farms and in households with pets. Use of antibiotics in early life has been linked 
to the development of asthma. Also, delivery via <b>caesarean section</b> is associated with 
an increased risk (estimated at 20�80%) of asthma � this increased risk is attributed to the 
lack of healthy bacterial colonization that the newborn would have acquired from passage 
through the birth canal. There is a link between asthma and the degree of affluence 
which may be related to the hygiene hypothesis as less affluent individuals often have more 
exposure to bacteria and viruses.

<p>
<u>Family history is a risk factor for asthma</u>, with many different genes being implicated. 
If one identical twin is affected, the probability of the other having the disease is <u>approximately 25%</u>.
By the end of 2005, 25 genes had been associated with asthma in six or more separate populations, 
including <b>GSTM1, IL10, CTLA-4, SPINK5, LTC4S, IL4R</b> and <b>ADAM33</b>, among others. 
Many of these genes are related to the immune system or modulating inflammation. 
Even among this list of genes supported by highly replicated studies, results have not been 
consistent among all populations tested. In 2006 over 100 genes were associated with asthma 
in one genetic association study alone; more continue to be found.<br>
Some genetic variants may only cause asthma when they are combined with specific environmental 
exposures. An example is a specific single <b>Nucleotide Polymorphism</b> in the CD14 region and 
exposure to <b>endotoxin (a bacterial product)</b>. Endotoxin exposure can come from several 
environmental sources including <b>tobacco smoke</b>, <b>dogs</b>, and <b>farms</b>. Risk for asthma, then, 
is determined by both a person's genetics and the level of endotoxin exposure.
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="3.4"><span>4. <u>Medical Conditions:-</u></span></h3>
<img src="./Resources/uio.jpg" height="250px" width="480px" alt="Asthma Causes" align="right">
<p>
A triad of <b>atopic eczema</b>, <b>allergic rhinitis</b> and <b>asthma</b> is called <u>atopy</u>. 
The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; with asthma occurring 
at a much greater rate in those who have either eczema or hay fever. Asthma has been 
associated with <b>Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (formerly known as Churg�Strauss syndrome)</b>, 
an autoimmune disease and vasculitis. Individuals with certain types of urticaria may also experience symptoms of asthma. <br>
There is a correlation between obesity and the risk of asthma with both having increased in recent years. 
Several factors may be at play including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of fat and the fact 
that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state<br>
Beta blocker medications such as <b>propranolol</b> can trigger asthma in those who are susceptible. 
Cardioselective beta-blockers, however, appear safe in those with mild or moderate disease. 
Other medications that can cause problems in asthmatics are <b>angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</b>, 
<b>aspirin</b>, and <b>NSAIDs</b>. Use of acid suppressing medication (proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers) 
during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of asthma in the child.
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="3.5"><span>5. <u>Exacerbation:-</u></span></h3>
<p>
Some individuals will have stable asthma for weeks or months and then suddenly develop 
an episode of acute asthma. Different individuals react to various factors in different ways. 
Most individuals can develop severe exacerbation from a number of triggering agents.<br>
Home factors that can lead to exacerbation of asthma include <b>dust, animal dander 
(especially cat and dog hair), cockroach allergens</b> and <b>mold</b>. <b>Perfumes</b> are a common 
cause of acute attacks in women and children. Both viral and bacterial infections of the 
upper respiratory tract can worsen the disease. Psychological stress may worsen 
symptoms � it is thought that stress alters the immune system and thus increases the 
airway inflammatory response to allergens and irritants.<br>
Asthma exacerbations in school-aged children peak in autumn, shortly after children 
return to school. This might reflect a combination of factors, including <b>poor 
treatment adherence, increased allergen</b> and <b>viral exposure</b>, and altered 
immune tolerance. There is limited evidence to guide possible approaches to reducing autumn 
exacerbations, but while costly, seasonal omalizumab treatment from four to six weeks before 
school return may reduce autumn asthma exacerbations.

<p>
Asthma is clinically classified according to the <b>frequency of symptoms</b>, <b>forced expiratory volume 
in one second (FEV1)</b>, and <b>peak expiratory flow rate</b>. Asthma may also be classified as <b>atopic 
(extrinsic)</b> or <b>non-atopic (intrinsic)</b>, based on whether symptoms are precipitated by allergens 
(atopic) or not (non-atopic). While asthma is classified based on severity, at the moment there 
is no clear method for classifying different subgroups of asthma beyond this system. 
Finding ways to identify subgroups that respond well to different types of treatments is a 
current critical goal of asthma research.<br>
Although asthma is a chronic obstructive condition, it is not considered as a part of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as this term refers specifically to combinations 
of disease that are irreversible such as <b>bronchiectasis</b> and <b>emphysema</b>. Unlike these 
diseases, the airway obstruction in asthma is usually reversible; however, if left untreated, 
the chronic inflammation from asthma can lead the lungs to become irreversibly obstructed 
due to airway remodeling. In contrast to <b>emphysema</b>, asthma affects the <b>bronchi</b>, not the <b>alveoli</b>.
