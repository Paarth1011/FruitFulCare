<b>Cancer</b> is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth 
with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. 
These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread. 
Possible signs and symptoms include a <b>lump, abnormal bleeding, 
prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss</b>, and a <b>change in bowel movements. </b>
While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they can also have other causes. 
Over 100 types of cancers affect humans.

<!--SYMPTOMS-->

<h2 id="1">Symptoms</h1>
<hr align="center" color="black" height="2px" width="100%">
<p>
When cancer begins, it produces no symptoms. 
Signs and symptoms appear as the mass grows or ulcerates. 
The findings that result depend on the cancer's type and location. 
Few symptoms are specific. Many frequently occur in individuals who have other conditions. 
Cancer can be difficult to diagnose and can be considered a "great imitator." 
<br><br>
People may become anxious or depressed post-diagnosis. The risk of suicide in people with cancer is approximately double.
</p>
<br>

<img src="./Resources/csi.jpg" height="330px" width="400px" alt="Cancer Symptoms" align="left">
<h3 id="1.1" class="a"><span>1. <u>Local Symptoms</u></span></h2>
<p class="b">
Local symptoms may occur due to the mass of the tumor or its ulceration. 
For example, mass effects from lung cancer can <b>block the bronchus</b> resulting in 
cough or <b>Pneumonia</b>; <b>Esophageal Cancer</b> can cause narrowing of the esophagus, 
making it difficult or painful to swallow; and colorectal cancer may lead to 
narrowing or blockages in the bowel, affecting bowel habits. Masses in breasts or 
testicles may produce observable lumps. Ulceration can cause bleeding that can 
lead to symptoms such as <b>coughing up blood</b> <u>(lung cancer)</u>, <b>anemia</b> or <b>rectal 
bleeding</b> <u>(colon cancer)</u>, <b>blood in the urine</b> <u>(bladder cancer)</u>, or <b>abnormal vaginal 
bleeding</b> <u>(endometrial or cervical cancer)</u>. Although localized pain may occur in 
advanced cancer, the initial tumor is usually painless. Some cancers can cause a 
buildup of fluid within the chest or abdomen.
</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3 id="1.2"><span>2. <u>Systemic Symptoms</u></span></h2>
<img src="./Resources/bd.png" height="500px" width="430px" alt="Cancer Symptoms" align="right">
<p>
Systemic symptoms may occur due to the body's response to the cancer. 
This may include <b>fatigue, unintentional weight loss</b>, or <b>skin changes</b>. Some 
cancers can cause a systemic inflammatory state that leads to ongoing muscle 
loss and weakness, known as <b>Cachexia</b>.
Some types of cancer such as <b>Hodgkin disease</b>, leukemias and cancers of the l
iver or kidney can cause a persistent fever. Some systemic symptoms of cancer 
are caused by hormones or other molecules produced by the tumor, known as 
<b>paraneoplastic syndromes.</b> Common paraneoplastic syndromes include 
hypercalcemia which can cause altered mental state, constipation and dehydration, 
or hyponatremia that can also cause altered mental status, vomiting, headache or seizures.
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="1.3"><span>3. <u>Metastatis</u></span></h2>
<p>
<u>Metastatis is the spread of cancer to other locations in the body</u>. 
The dispersed tumors are called metastatic tumors, while the original is 
called the primary tumor. Almost all cancers can metastasize. 
Most cancer deaths are due to cancer that has metastasized.<br><br>
Metastasis is common in the late stages of cancer and it can occur via 
the blood or the lymphatic system or both. The typical steps in metastasis 
are local invasion, intravasation into the blood or lymph, circulation through 
the body, extravasation into the new tissue, proliferation and angiogenesis. 
Different types of cancers tend to metastasize to particular organs, but 
overall the most common places for metastases to occur are the lungs, liver, brain and the bones.
</p>
<br>

<!--FREQUENCY-->

<h2 id="2">Frequency / Rarity</h2>

<p>
<u><b>Rarity:-</b></u> 23.7% (2020) <br>
<u><b>Frequency:-</b></u> 90.5 million (2020)<br>
<u><b>Deaths:-</b></u> 2.2 million(2020)
</p>
<br>

<!--CAUSES-->
<h2 id="3">Causes</h2>
<hr align="center" color="black" height="2px" width="100%">
<br>
<p>
<img src="./Resources/cci.jpg" height="350px" width="450px" alt="Cancer Causes" align="right">
The majority of cancers, some 90-95% of cases, are due to genetic mutations from 
environmental and lifestyle factors. The remaining 5-10% are due to inherited genetics. 
Environmental refers to any cause that is not inherited, such as lifestyle, economic, and 
behavioral factors and not merely pollution. Common environmental factors that 
contribute to cancer death include tobacco use (25-30%), diet and obesity (30-35%), 
infections (15-20%), radiation (both ionizing and non-ionizing, up to 10%), lack of 
physical activity, and pollution.Psychological stress does not appear to be a risk 
factor for the onset of cancer, though it may worsen outcomes in those who 
already have cancer.<br>
It is not generally possible to prove what caused a particular cancer because the 
various causes do not have specific fingerprints. For example, if a person who uses 
tobacco heavily develops lung cancer, then it was probably caused by the tobacco use, 
but since everyone has a small chance of developing lung cancer as a result of air 
pollution or radiation, the cancer may have developed for one of those reasons.
</p>

<img src="./Resources/ccg.png" height="650px" width="400px" alt="Cancer Chemical Causes" align="left">
<h3 id="3.1" class="a"><span>1. <u>Checmicals:-</u></span></h2>
<p class='b'>
Exposure to particular substances have been linked to specific types of cancer. 
These substances are called <b>carcinogens</b>. <br><br>
<b>Tobacco smoke</b>, for example, causes <b>90% of lung cancer</b>. It also causes cancer 
in the <b>larynx, head, neck, stomach, bladder, kidney, esophagus</b> and <b>pancreas</b>. 
Tobacco smoke contains over fifty known carcinogens, including <b>nitrosamines </b>
and <b>polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.</b> <br>
Tobacco is responsible for about one in five cancer deaths worldwide 
and about one in three in the developed world. Lung cancer death 
rates in the United States have mirrored smoking patterns, with increases 
in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, 
more recently, decreases in smoking rates since the 1950s followed by 
decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since 1990.<br>
In Western Europe, 10% of cancers in males and 3% of cancers in females are attributed to 
alcohol exposure, especially liver and digestive tract cancers. Cancer from work-related 
substance exposures may cause between 2 and 20% of cases, causing at least 200,000 deaths. 
Cancers such as lung cancer and mesothelioma can come from inhaling tobacco smoke or 
asbestos fibers, or leukemia from exposure to benzene.<br><br>
Under a microscope, metastatic cancer cells generally look the same as cells of the original cancer. Moreover, metastatic cancer cells and cells of the original cancer usually have some molecular features in common, such as the presence of specific chromosome changes.
</p>

<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>

<h3 id="3.2"><span>2. <u>Infections:-</u></span></h2>
<img src="./Resources/cig.jpg" height="350px" width="500px" alt="Cancer Infection Causes" align="right">
<p>
Worldwide approximately <b>18%</b> of cancer deaths are related to <b>infectious diseases.</b> 
This proportion ranges from a high of 25% in Africa to less than 10% in the developed world. 
Viruses are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but cancer bacteria and parasites 
may also play a role. <br><br>
<b>Oncoviruses (viruses that can cause cancer)</b> include human <b>papillomavirus (cervical cancer)</b>
, <b>Epstein�Barr virus (B-cell lymphoproliferative disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma)</b>, 
<b>Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphomas), hepatitis B 
and hepatitis C viruses (hepatocellular carcinoma)</b> and <b>human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (T-cell leukemias)</b>. 
Bacterial infection may also increase the risk of cancer, as seen in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinoma. 
Parasitic infections associated with cancer include <b>Schistosoma haematobium (squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder)</b> 
and the liver flukes, <b>Opisthorchis viverrini</b> and <b>Clonorchis sinensis (cholangiocarcinoma)</b>
<br><br>
Exposure to particular substances have been linked to specific types of cancer. 
These substances are called <b>carcinogens</b>. <br><br>
<b>Tobacco smoke</b>, for example, causes <b>90% of lung cancer</b>. It also causes cancer 
in the <b>larynx, head, neck, stomach, bladder, kidney, esophagus</b> and <b>pancreas</b>. 
Tobacco smoke contains over fifty known carcinogens, including <b>nitrosamines </b>
and <b>polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.</b> <br>
Tobacco is responsible for about one in five cancer deaths worldwide 
and about one in three in the developed world. Lung cancer death 
rates in the United States have mirrored smoking patterns, with increases 
in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, 
more recently, decreases in smoking rates since the 1950s followed by 
decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since 1990.

<br>
<br>

<img src="./Resources/crg.jpg" height="400px" width="640px" alt="Cancer Radiation Causes" align="left">
<h3 id="3.3"><span>3. <u>Radiations:-</u></span></h2>
<p>
Radiation exposure such as <b>ultraviolet radiation</b> and radioactive material is a risk factor for cancer. 
Many <b>non-melanoma skin cancers</b> are due to ultraviolet radiation, mostly from sunlight. 
Sources of ionizing radiation include <b>redical imaging and radon gas. </b>
Ionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen. Residential exposure to radon gas, 
for example, has similar cancer risks as <b>passive smoking</b>. Radiation is a more potent source 
of cancer when combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon plus tobacco smoke. <br><br><br>
Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals and at any age. 
Children are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation 
exposure before birth has ten times the effect.<br><br>

Medical use of ionizing radiation is a small but growing source of radiation-induced cancers. 
Ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers, but this may, in some cases, induce a 
second form of cancer. It is also used in some kinds of medical imaging.
Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other 
skin malignancies. Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the 
non-ionizing medium wave <b>UVB</b>, as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers, 
which are the most common forms of cancer in the world.
Non-ionizing radio frequency radiation from mobile phones, electric power transmission 
and other similar sources has been described as a possible carcinogen by 
the <b>World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer</b>. 
Evidence, however, has not supported a concern. This includes that studies 
have not found a consistent link between mobile phone radiation and cancer risk.
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="3.4"><span>4. <u>Heredity:-</u></span></h2>
<img src="./Resources/chg.jpg" height="420px" width="520px" alt="Cancer Heredity Causes" align="right">
<p>
The vast majority of cancers are <b>non-hereditary (sporadic)</b>. Hereditary cancers 
are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect. <b>Less than 0.3%</b> of the 
population are carriers of a genetic mutation that has a large effect on 
cancer risk and these cause less than 3 - 10% of cancer. Some of these 
syndromes include: certain inherited mutations in the genes <b>BRCA1</b> and <b>BRCA2 </b>
with a more than 75% risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and <b>Hereditary 
Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome)</b>, which is present in 
about 3% of people with colorectal cancer, among others. 
Statistically for cancers causing most mortality, the relative risk of developing 
colorectal cancer when a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has been 
diagnosed with it is about 2. The corresponding relative risk is 1.5 for lung cancer, 
and 1.9 for prostate cancer. For breast cancer, the relative risk is 1.8 with a 
first-degree relative having developed it at 50 years of age or older, and 3.3 when the 
relative developed it when being younger than 50 years of age.
Taller people have an increased risk of cancer because they have more cells than 
shorter people. Since height is genetically determined to a large extent, taller people 
have a heritable increase of cancer risk.
</p>
<br>

<!--DIAGNOSIS-->

<h2 id="4">Diagnosis</h2>
<hr align="center" color="black" height="2px" width="100%">
<br>
<p>
<img src="./Resources/dg.png" height="280px" width="380px" alt="Cancer Diagnosis" align="right">
Most cancers are initially recognized either because of the appearance of <b>signs or symptoms 
or through screening</b>. Neither of these leads to a definitive diagnosis, which requires the 
examination of a tissue sample by a pathologist. People with suspected cancer are 
investigated with medical tests. These commonly include <b>blood tests, X-rays, (contrast) CT scans</b> and 
<b>endoscopy</b>.<br><br> 
The tissue diagnosis from the biopsy indicates the type of cell that is proliferating, 
its histological grade, genetic abnormalities and other features. Together, this 
information is useful to evaluate the prognosis and to choose the best treatment. 
<b>Cytogenetics</b> and <b>ImmunoHistoChemistry</b> are other types of tissue tests. I
These tests provide information about molecular changes 
(such as mutations, fusion genes and numerical chromosome changes) and may 
thus also indicate the prognosis and best treatment. 
Cancer diagnosis can cause psychological distress and psychosocial interventions, 
such as talking therapy, may help people with this.
